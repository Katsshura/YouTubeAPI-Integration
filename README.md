# YouTubeAPI-Integration

This project was designed to exercise and apply knowledge of Angular and .Net Core/Standard as well as learn more about CSS and Html.

I must remember that this project has no link to google and is not one of its products. The only relationship it has is the integration of YouTube Google API V3 within the project.
